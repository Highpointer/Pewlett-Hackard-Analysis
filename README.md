2) These 72,458 employees have accumulated a total of 133,776 job titles. This is because many employees have had multiple job titles during their careers at PH, due to promotions and changes in their work responsibilities. For example, Sumant Peac was hired as Assistant Engineer in 1985, promoted to Engineer in 1990, and then promoted to Senior Engineer in 1995 and has been working at that position for the past 27 years.

4) Since tens of thousands of PH employees may retire soon, it is imperative that PH hire more employees. These employees need to be trained and mentored so that they will have long, successful careers at PH. Experienced employees who are not eligible to retire yet, but may become eligible within the next 10 years, are good candidates to mentor these new employees. Employees born in the year 1965 (ten years younger than employees born in 1955) will be considered for this program. The SQL analysis identifies 1,549 employees born in 1965.
